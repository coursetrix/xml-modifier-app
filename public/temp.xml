      <text>The three-step formula requires the writer to recognize a topic, address a question about the topic, and demonstrate the significance of it all. These steps describe not only the development of your project, but your own as a researcher. When you move from step1 to step 2, you are no longer a mere data collector but a researcher interested in understanding something better. When you move from step 2 to step 3, you focus on why that understanding is significant. The significance might at first be just for yourself but you join a community of researchers when you state that significance from your readers&amp;#8217; point of view. In so doing, you create a stronger relationship with readers because you promise something in return for their interest in your report&amp;#8212;a deeper understanding of something that matters to them. At that point, you have posed a problem that they recognize needs a solution.</text>

Many students don&amp;#8217;t realize when they risk being charged with plagiarism because they are careless or misinformed. You run that risk when you do any of the following. One, quote, paraphrase, or summarize a source but fail to cite it. Two, you use ideas or methods from a source but fail to cite it. Three, you use the exact words of a source and you do cite it, but you fail to put those words in quotation marks or in a block quotation. Lastly, you paraphrase a source and cite it, but you use words so similar to those of the source that anyone can see that as you paraphrased, you followed the source word by word.</text>

      <text>Different fields use each differently. For examples, researchers in the humanities quote more than social and natural scientists, who typically paraphrase and summarize. However, there are some principles to follow. One must summarize when details are irrelevant or a source isn&amp;#8217;t important enough to warrant much space. One must paraphrase when you can state what a source says more clearly, or concisely or when your argument depends on the details in a source but not on its specific words.  There are several reasons to use quotes. First, the words themselves are evidence that backs up your reasons. Second, the words are from an authority who backs up your claims. Third, the words are strikingly original or express your key concepts so compelling that the quotations can frame an extended discussion. Lastly, a passage states a view that you disagree with, and to be fair you want to state it exactly.</text>

      <text>Readers do not read word by word, or sentence by sentence. They want to begin with a sense of the whole, its structure, and most important, why they should read your report in the first place. Then they use that sense of the whole and its aims to interpret its parts. It thus makes sense to start revising your overall organization, then its parts, then the clarity of your sentences, and, last, matters of spelling and punctuation.</text>
